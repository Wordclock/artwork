You'll find some templates for stickers, which can be put on top of various
universal IR remote controllers, e.g. the one sold at DX.com, see [1]. These
are quite common and used basically with every remote controllable LED product.

There are two templates available, which in essence should cover most of the
universal IR remote controllers on the market. Check the dimensions of your
controller in order to determine, which one you need.
