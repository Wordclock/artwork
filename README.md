# Wordclock artwork

This package provides various artworks useful for the Wordclock project. Among
other this includes the front panel designs for the Wordclock. There are
various versions available for the languages English and German. The designs
are PDF files taken from the wiki [page][1] of the original project.

These files can be used to produce the front panels needed for the Wordclock.
If you haven't the means to produce them yourself, you maybe interested in the
various collective orders organized by members of the mikrocontroller.net
forums. Refer to [this][2] and/or [this][3] for details on these orders.

Furthermore there are some templates for a sticker, which can be put on top of
various universal IR remote controllers, e.g. the one you can get from
[dx.com][4]. These templates were also taken from the wiki of the original
project, specifically from [here][5] and [there][6].
