    Wordclock artwork - README

This package provides various artworks useful for the Wordclock project. Among
other this includes the front panel designs for the Wordclock. There are
various versions available for the languages English and German. The designs
are PDF files taken from [1].

These files can be used to produce the front panels needed for the Wordclock.
If you haven't the means to produce them yourself, you maybe interested in the
various collective orders organized by members of the mikrocontroller.net
forums, see [2].

You'll find specific information for the different languages within the
appropriate directories.

Furthermore there are some templates for a sticker, which can be put on top of
various universal IR remote controllers, e.g. the one you can get from [4]. 
These were taken from [5].
